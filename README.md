# Data-Structures

There are 3 folders:

1. Current DS 1 Homework Assignments
	- Contains some of the homework assignments that the students just did this past winter quarter.
	- Unfortunately, I am not given access to the solutions.

2. Lecture Slides
	- These are some of the more useful and easy to follow lecture slides from when I took Data Structures.
	- You should start all of this by reading the "What You Should Already Know.pdf" document.

3. My Homework Assignments
	- Contains all of the homework assignments from when I took Data Structures.
	- I provided all of my homework solutions. I made sure back then to fix any bugs after my submissions were graded; however, there is a possibility some may still have bugs.
	- You will need Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 installed.
	- Download it at this link:
